Over the course of this project, we conducted a comprehensive analysis to predict the Ladder score (happiness) using the World Happiness Report 2023 dataset. We began with exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizing distributions (e.g., histograms of Ladder score), identifying outliers (via boxplots of Logged GDP per capita), and exploring relationships (regression plots and correlation heatmaps) to understand how features like Logged GDP per capita and Healthy life expectancy influence happiness. We then prepared the data by dropping irrelevant columns (e.g., Country name, Dystopia + residual) and handling missing values with mean imputation.

For modeling, we implemented and compared multiple regression approaches. First, we built a pipeline combining StandardScaler, PolynomialFeatures, and LinearRegression, achieving an R² of 0.8121 on the training data, highlighting the impact of non-linear transformations. Next, we split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets and fitted a Linear Regression model, calculating RMSE, MAE, and R² on the test set to assess generalization. We also applied Ridge Regression, using grid search to tune the alpha hyperparameter (best value: 0.01), resulting in a cross-validated R² of 0.7302 and a test R² of 0.6595, demonstrating effective regularization. Additionally, we saved the Ridge model for future use and generated visualizations (e.g., R² vs. alpha plots) to support our findings.

Finally, we interpreted the results, noting that economic and health factors strongly predict happiness, while the tuned Ridge model balanced fit and generalization. This process provided insights into happiness determinants and showcased the importance of model selection and hyperparameter tuning in achieving robust predictions.
